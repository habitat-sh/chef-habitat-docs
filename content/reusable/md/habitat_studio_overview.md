The Chef Habitat Studio is a clean, self-contained, minimal environment where you can develop, build, and package software without relying on an upstream operating system distribution. All tools and dependencies included in the Studio are installed as Chef Habitat packages, which helps prevent unwanted dependencies from being used by your package.
