Chef Habitat Builder acts as the core of Chef's Application Delivery Enterprise hub.
It provides a repository for all available Chef Habitat packages built by Chef and the supporting community, as well as search and other APIs for clients.

<!-- Should we add an overview about license here -->
You can also deploy the [on-prem version of Chef Habitat Builder](https://github.com/habitat-sh/on-prem-builder) where you can store and maintain your apps in a secure environment.
