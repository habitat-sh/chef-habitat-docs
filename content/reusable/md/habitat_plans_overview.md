A plan is the set of instructions, templates, and configuration files that define how you download, configure, make, install, and manage the lifecycle of the application artifact. The plan for the application is typically defined in the `habitat` directory at the root of your project repository.

The `habitat` directory includes a plan file (`plan.sh` for Linux systems or `plan.ps1` for Windows), a `default.toml` file, an optional `config` directory for configuration templates, and an optional `hooks` directory for lifecycle hooks. Values for default configuration settings are specified in the `default.toml`, which are then used to render configuration template. You can create this directory at the root of your application using the Habitat CLI as `hab plan init`.
